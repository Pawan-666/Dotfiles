Repress all you know.
My apologies, Eno, but it's all in your head.
Fiction based off truths, you led me to aid you, guide you.

You are the language.
Ever flowing, ever echoing.
You are [4x]

On the eve of knowing all, my dear Eno,
patience 'cause this all subsides in due time,
all will be clear.

And the truth is I couldn't love you more than I have come to know.
And this Mother Sun is proud to have watched you grow.
You are the perceiver, that perceived the parable, the never-ending end.
You are the infinite (intuit), you are the finite (fire).
You are [4x]

You are the perceiver, that perceived the parable, the never-ending end.
You are the infinite (intuit), you are the finite (fire).
You are [4x]

[Speech by Allan Watts:]
"In other words, the so-called involuntary circulation of your blood is one continuous process with the stars shining.
If you find out it's you who circulates your blood, you will at the same moment find out that you are shining the sun.
Because your physical organism is one continuous process with everything else that's going on.
Just as the waves are continuous with the ocean.
Your body is continuous with the total energy system of the cosmos, and it's all you.
Only you're playing the game that you're only this bit of it."
