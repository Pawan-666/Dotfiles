Exponential separation
Process brought on by the rift [2x]

Jai guru deva om
Existence echoing

Jai guru deva om
The sum of everything

Disconnected by a ruse
Let them cower in the dark
The time has come for our re-emergence
The rift is sealed
Now rise in groves (now rise in groves)
Eclipsing what we seek

Integration--it has begun
Intuition combined with our calculations
Will revive the Mother Sun
