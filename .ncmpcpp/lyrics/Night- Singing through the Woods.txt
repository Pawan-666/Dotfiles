Hey Helen
Your eyes shine and your beautiful
So I just had to come and sing to you
And Helen
Made me feel alive last night just to meet you
So this is the best I can bring to you

[Chorus:]
Cos you sent me singing through the woods
last night
You sent me singing through the woods
Feeling all right
You sent me singing through the woods
Last night
You sent me singing A happy singing boy because of you.

And Helen I don’t know you you don’t know me
But what can I say? I just like you
And Helen
Im just trying to bring to you
All the things I would love for you to bring to me too

[Chorus]

Hey Helen
There’s people all round this country not taking risks or being all we can be
Start yellin
That you want to step out of the door with me and really take the chance of being free and I will to yeah

[Chorus]

Someone to make you remember those dreams you dreamed in December
I feel the life coming through ya
And it made me want to pursue ya
I feel alive
I feel alive
I feel alive
I feel alive
And it makes me want to hold to ya

[Chorus]

Feels like Feels like coming home
Feels like feels like coming home
Etc to end.
