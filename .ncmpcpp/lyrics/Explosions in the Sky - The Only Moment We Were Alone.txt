We're young and in love
And we're running like the wind, we got it all
We're never alone
If we got each other we can save the world

Explosions in the sky
I see colors fly
It's like the Fourth of July in your eyes

Old enough, old enough, old enough to know
That we are young in love, young in love
Young and in love
You and me, we can see time will stand still
If we stay young in love, young in love
Young and in love

Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love, oh

Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love, oh

We're turning it up
Play the music loud so we can sing along
And teach me all the words to all your favorite songs
We can make this moment last all summer long

Explosions in the sky
I see colors fly
It's like the Fourth of July in your eyes

Old enough, old enough, old enough to know
That we are young in love, young in love
Young and in love
You and me, we can see time will stand still
If we stay young in love, young in love
Young and in love

Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love, oh

Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love, oh

And you break my walls down
Cause you make me fall apart in a good way
In a good way

Old enough, old enough, old enough to know
That we are young in love, young in love
Young and in love
You and me, we can see time will stand still
If we stay young in love, young in love
Young and in love

Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love, oh
(Yeah we are young and in love)

Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love, oh
(Yeah we are young and in love)

Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love, oh

Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love
Yeah we are young and in love, oh
